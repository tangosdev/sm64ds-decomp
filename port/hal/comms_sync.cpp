// HOST-AUTHORITATIVE STATE SYNC. Run mg16 lane MP4.
//
// THE DESIGN IS runs/mg16/status/MP4-DESIGN.md and this file implements it.
// Read that first: it says what this does, what it deliberately does NOT do,
// and what the correction constants are guesses about.
//
// WHAT THIS STAGE IS. The gate ruled the build order: SY4 and SY0 before any
// sync sends. So this file currently implements the LAYER -- the enable
// decision, the contract check, the refusal, the readout -- and NOT the sending
// or applying of state. That is deliberate and it is the checkpoint: prove that
// OFF is unchanged and that a v1 transport is refused cleanly, before any code
// exists that could move a remote body.
//
// ============================ WHERE THIS SITS ==============================
//
// OUTSIDE THE ROM-FAITHFUL PATH, entirely. Nothing in src/ knows this exists.
// The DS input-lockstep -- src/func_0203df40.c, src/func_0203ea5c.c and the
// seam under them -- runs exactly as it does today whether this is on or off,
// and remains the SHIPPED DEFAULT. This layer only ever corrects where a REMOTE
// body ended up, after the ROM has already decided it.
//
// That separation is the owner's condition and it is also what keeps a DS
// back-port possible: everything this file does is port-side, so a build for
// real hardware simply does not include it.
//
// ========================= WHAT IT IS NOT ==================================
//
// NO ROLLBACK. NO RESIMULATION. NO INPUT PREDICTION. No history buffer. Named
// here because they are what everyone reaches for next and they are a different
// architecture with a different cost. This layer sends where bodies ARE and
// nudges remote copies toward it.
//
// AND IT NEVER CORRECTS THE LOCAL PLAYER. Your own character is simulated from
// your own input with no latency and is already right; correcting it is what
// makes a netcode feel like rubber. rung SY2 asserts it.

//
// THREE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRUE and each failure is silent-by-default except the
// one that is a surprise:
//
//   the knob is on          -- SM64DS_SYNC=1. Default off means an unset
//                              environment gets the DS path, which is what
//                              makes SY4 (off is byte-identical) meaningful.
//   a transport is installed-- solo has nobody to sync with.
//   THE TRANSPORT IS v2     -- it must actually be able to carry aux messages.
//
// THE THIRD ONE IS THE INTERESTING FAILURE and it gets a loud line, once. A
// transport that reports v1, or reports v2 and leaves an aux entry null, cannot
// carry sync, and the honest thing is to say so and fall back to the DS path
// rather than to half-enable and produce a session where remote bodies
// mysteriously never correct. The seam INSTALLS such a transport happily -- the
// aux entries are the optional half of the contract -- so this is the only
// place the difference is noticed.
