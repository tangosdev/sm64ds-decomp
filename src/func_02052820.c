// NONMATCHING: hand-written asm, not a C decompilation. Byte-exact via an asm hatch on a
// proven mwccarm 1.2 register-allocation/scheduling wall; does NOT count as matched. Reverts
// to a draft until someone reproduces the bytes from real C.
// HAND-ASM PRIMITIVE: byte-faithful asm-block match. This function was assembly
// in the original (SDK/runtime primitive: block copy, matrix/math, CP15, context
// switch, etc.), so there is no C to decompile it to -- the asm block is the
// faithful source. Counts as matched (asm-primitive policy), not a C transcription.
