/* recovered: real C++ deleting destructor -- the compiler emits the whole body
 *
 * D0 is the DELETING destructor: destroy through this class and its bases --
 * which is why more than one vptr store appears -- then return the object to
 * its heap. Nobody writes that; declaring `~ModelAnim2()` is enough, because mwcc
 * emits D2, D0 and D1 together and objisolate keeps the one this file is bound
 * to.
 *
 * The deallocation is an inline operator delete, which is why nothing below
 * mentions a heap.

/* THE HOST NEEDS THE ROM'S THREE SYMBOLS, AND MSVC ONLY MAKES ONE. It folds

 * host link refuses them -- measured, LNK2005 twice over for the ModelBase
 * triple alone. The D1 file keeps the definition; this file spells out, in
 * terms of it, what the variant this file is enrolled for actually does.
 * Nothing here reaches mwccarm: it builds the `#else` arm and emits the ROM
 * bytes it always emitted, and the object is byte-identical either way. */
