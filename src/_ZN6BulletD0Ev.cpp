/* recovered: real C++ deleting destructor -- the compiler emits the whole body

 * D0 is the DELETING destructor: destroy through this class and its bases, then
 * return the object to its heap. Declaring `~Bullet()` is enough -- mwcc emits
 * D2, D0 and D1 together and objisolate keeps the one this file is bound to.
 *
 * The deallocation is an inline operator delete -- dEnemyBase_c's, reachable because
 * dEnemyBase_c is this class's IMMEDIATE base.

 * definition below as well would define that symbol twice. This arm
 * spells out, in terms of it, what the deleting destructor this file is
 * enrolled for does: the D1 body, called qualified so it is a direct call
 * even where a header declares the destructor virtual, then the
 * class-specific operator delete. Nothing here reaches mwccarm: it builds
 * the `#else` arm and emits the ROM bytes it always emitted, and the
 * object is byte-identical either way. */
